## Task1 
If you already have all the 'mandanga' run the task1.py script with the following file names configuration: <codec>_<resolution>.<format>.

  - codec: vp8, vp9, h265, av1
  - resolution: 720p, 480p, 360x240, 160x120
  - format: webm (vp8 and vp9), mp4 (h265), mkv(av1)
  
  And remember to put all the videos in the same directory as the scripts.

  The first exercise is set up display the 4 videos with the 720p resolution, but you can display it by typing 1,2,3 or 4 inside mandanga(-).
  
If you want to run the application from the BBB 10 minutes video (full process), name this file bbb.mp4 and uncomment the indicated lines in the script.
